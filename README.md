# RNAseqFrankfurt2023

This repository contains

* A compact lecture, rendered as html slides (`RNAseq_Frankfurt_lecture.html`)
* A full version of that lecture, rendered as html slides (`RNAseq_one_full_day.html`)
* A practical session document (`RNAseq_Frankfurt_practical.html`)
* The source files for each of these files

For the practical session, open the `RNAseq_Frankfurt.Rproj` file in RStudio, and 
open the `RNAseq_Frankfurt_practical.Rmd` file to follow along the different chunks.
